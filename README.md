# Colobot
Colobot CBOT language code snippets

Colobot is a exoplanet exploration game, where you as an astronaut are all alone but with the ability to construct structures and bots.
Although the bots can be controlled manually, the aim to the game is to program these bots as to automate their duties, and that makes everything that much easier and more efficient.
These bots and their programs are usually crucial to complete mission objectives. 
With enough automation and good enough code, one can just sit back and marvel as the bots work in unison and complete the mission. Or fail in some funny way. :)
